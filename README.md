# California_woody_plant_metacommunity

These are data from [Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve](https://jrbp.stanford.edu/), collected by Will Cornwell and collaborators between 2001 and 2003.  

The core of the dataset are species x plot, species x trait, plot x environment matrices

If you use these data, please cite the original papers.
